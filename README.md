univocity-html-parser
=====================

This repository contains the source code and input files used to write the
official [tutorials](http://docs.univocity.com/tutorials/parsers/html/Tutorial.html)
of the [univocity-html-parser](https://github.com/univocity/univocity-html-parser-api) 

This is the result of 5 years of research and development to make working with HTML
as effortless as possible.

**Some of the things it can do:**
	
* Handles the trickiest, messiest and most horrible HTML cleanly

* Join pieces of data scattered in multiple pages with zero effort

* Built-in support for historical data organization and re-parsing

* Handles pagination and linked pages automatically

* Download page resources better than your browser

* Helps you to identify new elements in updated pages

Read through the [tutorials](http://docs.univocity.com/tutorials/parsers/html/Tutorial.html)
and execute the examples here to try it out!

The API is fully documented and the [javadocs are here](http://docs.univocity.com/parser/html/2.0.0/index.html).

We hope you enjoy!
